*** Next Steps
**** Map
Highlight on mouse over, info on click.

Zooming.

Refactor code so it makes better sense (similar to how we did unit cards).
**** Units
Add units to the map.

Make the units presentation types.
**** Movement
Calculate movement as simple straight-line distance (I can use this calculation for range later).
**** Attack
Roll to hit.
Roll for damage.

Manage screen updates.
** 0.1.1
*** Planned Expansion
**** Map
The hex drawing is confusing and needs to be cleaned up. I also don't like the positioning of the hex number.

Make presentation types for the minimap hexes (if necessary).
