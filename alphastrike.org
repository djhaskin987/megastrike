I don't like the way I'm currently handling elements, it's going to need significant rewriting.

I want to store the unit data in SQLite to see how that works.
*** Map
I don't want to store the map in a hash because it results in duplicated data. The address will have to be in a list that is used as the has key and also in the object itself. Maybe that's not a problem? But I don't like it.
Storing it in a 3d array or a 2d array works because then data isn't duplicated, but that might be complicated. I think I will probably build them both and see what's going on.
